# Thanks for using CoffeeTime!

Thank you for trying out **CoffeeTime**. This blog posts will pose first as an example post to refer to, and second as a simple introduction on how to go on from here.

**CoffeeTime** generates a minimalistic project structure for you. `_posts` is where you will write your blog posts in Markdown. 
In `_layouts` you will find templates to modify. Your Markdown files will be converted to html and put into those templates. 
And finally, `_site` will be the final output of your site which you will use at the end to deploy.
You can also write *pages*, which are seperate from *posts*. You can just put those markdown files into the root folder of your project.

For more information (hopefully lole), check out the [Github](https://github.com/mikulex/coffeetime) page.
